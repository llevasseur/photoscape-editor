# photoscape-editor
A project devoted to automating game score updates for social media posts, particularly for sports using PhotoScape X.

## Initial Thoughts
**Input:** template.psxprj, url for sports stats
**Output:** jpg

Will need two projects that work together.
1. ESPN Stat Scrapper
 - Take url and determine relevant stats.
 - Save as json.

2. PhotoScape Editor
 - Unzip template input json format.
 - Alter json file and zip file as psxprj or jpg.
